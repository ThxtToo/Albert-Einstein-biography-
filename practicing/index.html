        <p>Albert Einstein was a German physicist of the 19th and 20th centuries (born March 14, 1879, died April 18, 1955) known mainly for the development of the theory of relativity (special and general) and the theoretical explanation of Brownian motion and the photoelectric effect.</p>

        <h2>Quantum Theory</h2>
        <p>Einstein suggested that light doesn’t just travel as waves but as electric currents. This photoelectric effect could force metals to release a tiny stream of particles known as ‘quanta’. From this Quantum Theory, other inventors were able to develop devices such as television and movies. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.</p>

        <h2>Special Theory of Relativity</h2>
        <p>This theory was written in a simple style with no footnotes or academic references. The core of his theory of relativity is that:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Movement can only be detected and measured as relative movement; the change of position of one body in respect to another.”</p>
        </blockquote>
